As India &amp; US discuss situation in the region, Chinese ambassador @$T$_Amb_India suddenly talks about not letting differences turn into disputes. Why did China then bring 2 Divisions to #LAC &amp; face off at #Galwan or occupy land b/w Finger 4 &amp; 8 at #PangongTso? China no friend https://t.co/6ej7QrK1nd

If you believe that $T$ judgement is influenced by Modi Government, not independently judged by the Supreme Court of India.  Trust me, this danger in our democracy is much bigger trouble than delays in Ram Mandir construction.

Did Congress play a Me too card on $T$? @shashitharoor has this to say on Hinduism Vs Hindutva. But he also has a view on PM @NarendraModi beard for the big moment. "He wanted to appear a Rishi Raj, to say I am sage, I am warrior"- Full intvw coming to @themojo_in https://t.co/75zPTWDe9h

Since $T$ is our integral part, the least we should know is that most area occupied by Pakistan is Jammu, not Kaasmeer.  Even our Deshbhakt Pakistan experts giving sermons to the Govt refer to Poonch as an area in Kashmir. Poonch and Pak occupied Poonch is Jammu. Read maps.

“The fact is that Modi has been a failure as Prime Minister of India. He may have been a success as a $T$ icon, as a representative of the BJP, as a member of the RSS. He has indeed increased sectarian hatred and violence.”    https://t.co/1v9cBGGkbZ    @ranjona states the facts

$T$ protestors feel they should not have to prove their Indian citizenship. But they want special privileges that ordinary citizens do not have, including the right to occupy public spaces and disrupt public activity for months on end. What principles do they represent?

If $T$ is a global threat, as some are proposing, please show us the countries suffering from Hindu originated terrorism, Hindu based criminal activities, or Hindu violence and subversion of any type. On the contrary, Hindus are everywhere among the most peaceful groups.

AAP will get enough Muslim votes in Delhi again. Just wait and watch. Then the same people will blame $T$ for giving way to AAP. They will say Congress didn't do "enough" to stop AAP. So Congress is responsible for AAP targeting them.

Clearer and clearer that the June 15 bloodbath in Galwan was not spontaneous, but was 100% Chinese premeditated. Spontaneous clashes between India-$T$ troops have never resulted in death or even serious injury, for instance this most recent one from late May in Pangong: https://t.co/0xR1HzEc74

This is how they converted each $T$s for last 1000 years.

When something happened in $T$ before the abrogation of article 370, we used to ask questions to the political class.  Now, we just express concern and sadness at the lives lost. Nobody is responsible.
