$T$ : My hair stylist a muslim man invested Rs. 5 lakhs in a salon in Shaheen Bagh but protests killed his business before it could take-off. Not a single person lost citizenship but many genuinely talented people lost employment, business and even their lives. Bilkis is not my hero. https://t.co/tiUrArik1f

$T$ : Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of Indo-Canadian Times, was killed at Surrey, #Canada, for opposing Khalistanis and deposing before investigators probing Air India Kanishka bombing.

$T$ : The police begin the RTI response by talking about Jamia &amp; the usual "burning of buses" garbage (which is totally irrelevant).  Then they mention that Shaheen Bagh protestors occupied Road No. 13A   (Pls note that the occupied part was only 100-150 metres)  (2/4)

$T$ : Shaheen Bagh protestors feel they should not have to prove their Indian citizenship. But they want special privileges that ordinary citizens do not have, including the right to occupy public spaces and disrupt public activity for months on end. What principles do they represent?

$T$ : Two massive protests, Both peacefully asking Govt to roll back a Bad Bill, Only one manages to make the Govt. bend over backwards. Why?

$T$ : Despite their different trajectories, Shaheen Bagh and farmers protests teach us a lesson that we would do well to learn: in political cultures beleaguered by majoritarianism, mobilized minorities offer the most reliable resistance to bigotry and reaction. https://t.co/6T5Noxt1FT
